    <h3>Transforms and Transitions</h3>
    <p>Transforms: The CSS3 transform property lets you lets you translate, rotate, scale, and/or skew any element on the page.</p>
    <p>Translation: Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and right along the x and y axes.</p>
    <p>Scaling: The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio</p>
    <p>Rotation: The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value. As with scale, by default the point of origin is the element’s center. Generally, angles are declared in degrees, with positive degrees moving clockwise and negative moving counterclockwise. In addition to degrees, values can be provided in grads, radians, or turns, but we’ll just be sticking with degrees.</p>
    <p>Transitions: Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations. </p>

    <h3>Canvas, SVG, and Drag and Drop</h3>
    <p>Canvas: With HTML5’s Canvas API, we can draw anything we can imagine, all through JavaScript. This can improve the performance of our websites by avoiding the need to download images off the network. With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns. </p>
    <p>SVG:stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, a specific file format that allows you to describe vector graphics using XML.</p>
