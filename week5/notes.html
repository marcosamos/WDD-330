    <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>
    <p>Errors are caused when something goes wrong in a program. They are usually caused by one of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>System error ― there’s a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is interacting</li>
        <li>Programmer error ― the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be as simple as a typo</li>
        <li>User error ― the user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Exceptions: is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the program to deal with the error</p>

    <p>Warnings: A warning can occur if there’s an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program to crash. This means the program will continue to run after a warning.</p>
    <p>strict mode: 'use strict';</p>
    <p>Debuggin in the Browser: Debugging is the process of finding out where bugs occur in the code and then dealing with them.</p>
