    <h3>Further Functions</h3>
    <p>In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, which means they can be passed around in the same way as every other value. They can have their own properties and methods, as well as accepting other functions as parameters and being returned by other functions. </p>
    <h3>AJAX</h3>
    <p>Ajax is a technique that allows web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server, and it dynamically updates web pages without reloading</p>
    <p>Clients and Servers: The web of computers known as the internet can be separated into two parts: clients and servers. A client, such as a web browser, will request a resource (usually a web page) from a server, which processes the request and sends back a response to the client.</p>
    <p>APIs: An application programming interface (API) is a collection of methods that allows external access to another program or service. Many websites allow controlled access to their data via public APIs.</p>
    <p>The fetch() method in JavaScript is used to request data from a server. The request can be of any type of API that return the data in JSON or XML. The fetch() method requires one parameter, the URL to request, and returns a promise.</p>
