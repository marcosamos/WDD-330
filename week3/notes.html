    <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
    <h3>Objects in Javascript</h3>
    <p>An object in JavaScript is a self-contained set of related values and functions. 
        They act as a collection of named properties that map to any JavaScript value such as strings, numbers, booleans, arrays and functions.
         If a propertys value is a function, it is known as a method.</p>
    <p>All objects are mutable at any time when a program is running. This means that its properties and methods can be changed or removed, and new properties and methods can be added to the object, even if it was declared using const.</p>

    <h3>Document object model</h3>
    <h3>What is it?</h3>
    <p>The Document Object Model (DOM) allows you to access elements of a web page and enable interaction with the page by adding and removing elements, changing the order, content and attributes of elements, and even altering how they are styled.</p>
    <p>the <em>document.querySelector</em> for me is the best way</p>
    <p>The <em>childNodes</em>  property is a list of all the nodes that are children of the node concerned.</p>
    <p>The <em>children</em> property only returns any element nodes that are children of that node, so will ignore any text nodes. </p>
    <p>The <em>firstChild</em> property returns the first child of a node</p>
    the <em>lastChild</em> property returns the last child of a node
