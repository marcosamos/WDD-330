    <h3>Validating forms</h3>
    <p>This is called form validation. When you enter data, the browser and/or the web server will check to see that the data is in the correct format and within the constraints set by the application. Validation done in the browser is called client-side validation</p>
    <p>If the information is correctly formatted, the application allows the data to be submitted to the server and (usually) saved in a database; if the information isn't correctly formatted, it gives the user an error message explaining what needs to be corrected, and lets them try again.</p>
    <h3>Using fetch</h3>
    <p>sending a request with credentials</p>
