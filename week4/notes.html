    <h3>Forms</h3>
    <p>Forms are made up of a <form> element that contains form controls such as input fields, select menus and buttons. These input fields can be populated with information that is processed once the form has been submitted</p>
    <p><em>document.forms</em>, that returns an HTML collection of all the forms in the document in the order they appear in the markup. intead this can be acces with the <em>name</em>  attribute</p>
    <p>Example <em>document.forms.name</em></p>
    <p>Form properties and Methods: A form can be submitted manually by the user employing a button or input element with a type attribute of submit, or even an input element with a type attribute of image</p>
    <p>The form.reset() method will reset all the form controls back to their initial values specified in the HTML. <br>
        A button with a type attribute of reset can also be used to do this without the need for additional scripting</p>
    <p>The <em>form.action</em> property can be used to set the action attribute of a form, so itâ€™s sent to a different URL to be processed on the server</p>
    <p>placeholder: it is an attribute in HTML, Simply change the input field. </p>

    <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
    <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. <br> This approach has the benefit of keeping related pieces of code encapsulated in objects that maintain state throughout the life of the program. The objects can also be reused or easily modified, as required.</p>
    <p>Main concepts</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Encapsulation</li>
    <li>Polymorphism</li>
    <li>Ineheritance</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Moder JavaScript Development</h3>
    <p>Libraries</p>
    <p>A JavaScript library is a piece of code that provides several methods that make it easier to achieve common tasks. </p>
    <h3>Package Managers</h3>
    <p>Package managers allow developers to download modules from a central repository. A package is just a directory with one or more files of code, as well as a package.json file that contains information about the code in the package. </p>
    <p>Dependency:  is the process of ensuring that all the dependencies a module requires are met. This can be difficult to do manually once a project becomes large, so package managers can also help with dependency management.</p>
    <p>npm: The Node Package Manager was developed soon after Node.js was introduced to allow JavaScript code to be shared by developers. It has since grown into the largest repository of code libraries available.</p>
    <p>npm allows you to install JavaScript packages onto your machine. Some packages rely on other packages, so npm acts as a dependency manager.</p>
    <h3>Webpack</h3>
    <p>Webpack is a module bundler that takes all the JavaScript files used in your project and bundles them altogether in one file.</p>
