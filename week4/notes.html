    <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
    <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of programming that involves separating the code into objects that have properties and methods. <br> This approach has the benefit of keeping related pieces of code encapsulated in objects that maintain state throughout the life of the program. The objects can also be reused or easily modified, as required.</p>
    <p>Main concepts</p>

    <ul>
    <li>Encapsulation</li>
    <li>Polymorphism</li>
    <li>Ineheritance</li>
    </ul>
