    <h3>The window object</h3>
    <p>Every JavaScript environment has a global object. Any variables that are created in the global scope are actually properties of this object, and any functions are methods of it. In a browser environment the global object is the window object, which represents the browser window that contains a web page.</p>
    <p>The Browser Object Model (or BOM for short) is a collection of properties and methods that contain information about the browser and computer screen.</p>
    <p>A new window can be opened using the window.open()</p>
    <p>Cookies are small files that are saved locally on a userâ€™s computer.</p>
    <p>Timing Functions: setTimeout()</p>
    <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
    <p>The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser. </p>
    <p>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. </p>
    <p>The Notification API allows you to show messages using the system's notifications. This is usually a popup in the corner of the screen, but it changes depending on the operating system. An advantage of using the system notification is that they will still be displayed even if the web page that calls them isn't the current tab.</p>
